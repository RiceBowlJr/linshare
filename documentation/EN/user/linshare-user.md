##### My space

</a>

My space consists in 2 sides: your own files and the ones shared with you.

###### My files

**My files** gather all the files you uploaded on _your space_. Each shared file (which is not past the expiration date) is labeled "_shared_".</br>
To upload a new file, you have 2 choices:

- Clic on the **+** button on the upper left side.
- Drag and drop your file from your file browser to your own space (you can then see the center circle become blue).

When a uploaded file is hoovered, 3 icons appear on the right side. From left, those emojis mean:

- Display file's infos.
- Share the file with other users (internal or external, refer to <a name="share">Share</a>).
- Download the file.
